This README file contains information on the contents of the
test layer.

Please see the corresponding sections below for details.

This layer provides a recipe to generate a dummy package with
large file size. Configure the size by setting the version of
test-package to 1, 10 or 100. The version number corresponds
to the file size in MB. For example, add the following line
to conf/local.conf to generate test package with file size 10MB:

  PREFERRED_VERSION_test-package = "10"

I. Adding the test layer to your build
=================================================

In order to use this layer, you need to make the build system aware of
it.

Assuming the test layer exists at the top-level of your
yocto build tree, you can add it to the build system by adding the
location of the test layer to bblayers.conf, along with any
other layers needed. e.g.:

  BBLAYERS ?= " \
    /path/to/yocto/meta \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-poky \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-yocto-bsp \
    /path/to/yocto/meta-test \
    "


II. Misc
========

Add the following line to conf/local.conf to generate test
package with file size 1MB:

  PREFERRED_VERSION_test-package = "1"

Alternatively set the version to 10 or 100 to generate a package
with file size of 10MB or 100MB.
